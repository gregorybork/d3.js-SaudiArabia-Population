# Population Data Visualization / Saudi Arabia

Uses the D3.js v5 JavaScript library to GeoMap Saudi Arabia


## Description

I acquired the ESRI Shapefile from https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html to convert to Topojson file using https://mapshaper.org/. I then found the most recent population data associeted with the subregions of the Saudi Arabia. I visualized the country data with subregions mapped to different colors based on population density. 

The goal of this project was to learn D3.js and its powerful functionality to elaboratly display data.

Users can:
  - Hover over subregions to view
